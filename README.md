Week 6 homework assignment
### Overview
This project focuses on creating a buttons driven interactive web page for displaying a collection of GIFs using AJAX, JQuery, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

### Purpose
The project taught us how to use AJAX to query a web service and return a collection of data that can in turn be presented on a web page.

### Assignment Description
This assignment created a web page that uses AJAX to query the GIFy web service. It provides the user with a collection of buttons. Each button is associated with a particular animal. When clicked, the button activates code to query the GIFy web site to return 10 GIFs and associated meta-data for the animal associated with the button that was clicked. The web page provides users with the means to enter new animals with associated buttons.
